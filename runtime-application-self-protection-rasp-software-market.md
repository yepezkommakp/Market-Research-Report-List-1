<p><h1>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) Software Market Research Report Provides Critical Insights that can help Shape Business Development and Investment Strategies</h1></p><p><strong>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) Software Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) software is a security technology that integrates with applications to detect and prevent real-time threats from within the application environment. By monitoring both the appâ€™s behavior and the runtime environment, RASP can identify malicious activity and enforce security policies dynamically. This allows organizations to safeguard sensitive data from attacks such as code injection, cross-site scripting, and other vulnerabilities without relying solely on traditional perimeter security measures.</p><p>The RASP market is experiencing robust growth driven by the increasing number of cyber threats and the rising need for advanced application security solutions. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud-based services and DevOps practices, the demand for integrated security measures that operate seamlessly within applications is on the rise. The Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.3% during the forecast period. Additionally, the emergence of regulations like GDPR and CCPA has further intensified the focus on application security. Key trends include the integration of RASP with other security solutions such as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and the growing utilization of artificial intelligence to enhance real-time threat detection and response capabilities.</p></p>
